## Dashboard Motivation: Why?

This dashboard allows NHL Fantasy hockey managers in points leagues to learn about skater performance in the context of the rules of their league for the 2021/2022 season.  It aims to help managers make more informed decisions on the skaters they choose who to draft or pick up off of waivers.

## Dashboard Contents: What?

The dashboard visualizes:

1) How many fantasy points each player scored per game
2) Which games they played
3) A fitted line for how many points they tended to score over the season
4) Their average points scored vs. the league
5) How consistent they are in scoring points each night vs. the league
